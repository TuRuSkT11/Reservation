# Airline Reservation System

This project is a Java-based Airline Reservation System designed to manage flight bookings for both domestic and international flights. It provides functionalities such as user login, flight selection, ticket printing, and reservation management.

## Features

- User authentication via a login page.
- Support for booking domestic and international flights.
- Ticket printing functionality.
- Intuitive graphical user interface with multiple interactive components.
- Organized code structure with separate classes for flights, UI listeners, and utilities.

## Technologies Used

- Java (100% of the codebase)
- Swing/AWT for GUI components (inferred from `.class` files and UI-related classes)

## Project Structure

- `DomesticFlight.java` / `.class`: Handles domestic flight details and operations.
- `InternationalFlight.java` / `.class`: Handles international flight details and operations.
- `LoginPage.java` / `.class`: Manages user login functionality.
- `PrintTicket1.java` / `.class`: Responsible for ticket printing.
- `ExitListener.java` / `.class`: Handles exit events.
- `WindowUtilities.java` / `.class`: Utility functions for window management.
- Other UI components and event handlers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version compatible with the source code).
- An IDE or command-line tools to compile and run Java programs.

### Running the Application

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/TuRuSkT11/Reservation.git
   cd Reservation
   ```

2. Compile the Java source files:

   ```
   javac *.java
   ```

3. Run the main application (likely starting from `LoginPage` or a main class):

   ```
   java LoginPage
   ```

*(Adjust the main class name if different.)*
